1) What does construction “try … catch” do?

-try block: You place the code that might throw an exception within a try block. This is the code that you want to monitor for errors.
-catch block: Following the try block, you have one or more catch blocks that handle specific types of exceptions. Each catch block is an exception handler that can process or respond to an exception thrown in the try block. 
If an exception occurs, the flow of control jumps to the matching catch block.
